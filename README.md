# BCMB Supply Tracker

## Project Overview

The **BCMB Supply Tracker** aims to provide a seamless solution for the members of the University of Tennessee's Biochemistry & Cellular and Molecular Biology Department to effectively track and manage supplies available in the main office. Built using the MERN stack.

## Planned Features

### For Office Members (Lashel, Chrissy, Ame, Trevor)

- **User Account Management**: 
  - Create accounts

- **Supply Management**:
  - View available supplies
  - Update supply quantities
  - Add supplies to an in-app cart for easy reordering 

- **Checkout Process**:
  - View cart contents
  - Redirect to Staples for checkout

- **Supply Requests**:
  - Review new supply requests submitted by general users
  - Respond to supply requests with a y/n and optional reason

### For General Users (Other Department Members)

- **Supply Visibility**:
  - Browse available supplies in the office

- **Request New Supplies**:
  - Submit requests for supplies not currently available

## Additional Considerations

- Integration with third-party services for checkout processes (no idea if this is possible)
  - e.g press checkout button in cart to be redirected to Staples with a pre-filled cart 
- Ensure user-friendly design and accessibility for all users.
